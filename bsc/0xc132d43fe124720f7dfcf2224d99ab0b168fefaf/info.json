 "description": "Dogeprof is a very interesting experiment. 
We are fed up with those mechanisms that 
bring irreparable bugs and a lot of scams.
As a result, many people lost money. These 
projects reduce people's trust, lead to 
suspicion and panic, and finally let one 
project die. Great projects like Doge and 
Shib can no longer be born! Dogeprof has no
service charge. The goal of the birth of 
dogeprof is to rebuild the security and trust
of the market. Like Shib, complete another 
26000 times task and let everything start 
from 0. This is a new social experiment. We
want to see how much 0 real trust can kill! 
Our ultimate goal is to eliminate all 0 and 
surpass Shib's historical record!.",
